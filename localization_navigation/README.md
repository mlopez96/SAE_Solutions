# Localization and Navigation
This repository contains a ROS2 package that implements an out-of-box SLAM algorithm for mapping and localization, experiment with the Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization package (AMCL) and implement "go-togoal" with the DWA local planner. PPT provided for tuning parameters changed.

# Tuning Guide
https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tuning.html  
Tuning Cartographer is unfortunately really difficult. The system has many parameters many of which affect each other. This tuning guide tries to explain a principled approach on concrete examples.
